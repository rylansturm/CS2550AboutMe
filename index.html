            <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
            <p class="essay">
                My personal interests center mainly around the two things I've pursued in school.
                I was seeking a degree in Music Education. Though I haven't found as much time as 
                I'd like lately for this interest, I enjoy playing piano and singing, picking up 
                new instruments, and recording songs either by myself or with friends.
            </p>
            <p class="essay">
                I am unsurprisingly also interested in computer projects. I get a lot of joy out of 
                coding, whether for work, school, or personal projects. I also have a handful of 
                Raspberry Pis and Arduino boards I like to tinker with. My workstation next to me
                is currently covered in PCBs and switches for a split keyboard that I am soldering
                together.
            </p>
            <p class="essay">
                Several years ago my sister pestered me to start doing CrossFit with her, and that led
                me to a whole new interest. I have done a lot of CrossFit over the past 8 years, and 
                even went through the training to coach it. For the past few years I have mainly only
                done basic strength and conditioning. For the last year I have been coaching two 
                clients remotely to make a little extra money.
